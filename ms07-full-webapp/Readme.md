# MileStone 7 

## Release 0: Let's get Appy

Each team has been given a unique problem to solve. Your aim is to build the WebApp by the end of this MileStone. 

## Release 1 : What all makes a WebApp? 

For this challenge, there are no specific releases. Instead we have certain features that definitely need to exist in your web app. 

- There should be at least 2 Resources (apart from Users) with full fledged CRUD routes for each. 
- Users should be able to Login/Logout and view a customised HomePage. 
- Logged in users should have access to certain functionality that non-logged in users don't have. 
- Views need to be designed well 
- You have to divide the app into parts and record progress in Trello
- Pay attention to Pair Programming, your flow, research, how you're debugging. Reflect on the various methodologies we have used to follow a streamlined process of development. 

## Release 2 : WebApp flow 

Usually you should follow the following flow to build a WebApp 

- What's the functionality? What exactly is the user doing? 
- Wireframes
- Create the back end with basic tasks 
- Test it!
- Merge the front end 
- Beautify the front end
